\np A Dats interpreter executes each statements from a Dats file sequentially. These
statements are always terminated by a semicolon.

\np There is no concept of \textit{musical measures} in Dats and as such,
there is also no concept of \textit{time signatures}.
You would need to mark the each \textit{musical measure} either by the convention
of this document in \nameref{formatting} or by your own preferences.

\np The start of a Dats file is called, \verb+main+.
