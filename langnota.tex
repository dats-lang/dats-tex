\subsection{Lexical elements}
\subsubsection{Character sets}

The Dats v2.0.0 language supports the 26 \textit{uppercase letters} and 26
\textit{lower case letter} of the \textit{Latin alphabet}:

\begin{verbatim}
       A B C D E F G H I J K L M
       N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
       a b c d e f g h i j k l m
       n o p q r s t u v w x y z
\end{verbatim}

the 10 {decimal digits}:
\begin{verbatim}
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
\end{verbatim}

and the miscs symbols:
\begin{verbatim}
       - + * / ( ) { } [ ] " ; = . , #
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Keywords}

\np Keywords: one of

\begin{verbatim}
       attack        bpm          track
       decay         filter       n
       main          mix          r

       | <note> "," <note>

\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{Length}

\subsubsection{Comments}
\np Just like in the C programming language, you can use a double slash (solidus if you like), \verb+//+.
It eats the letters/words in its front until it reaches a newline.
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      staff foo {
        n 1, c4; //EAT MEEE!!!
      }
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Declarations}

\subsection{\texttt{staff}}
\np The \textgray{staff} keyword signifies the beginning of a staff. It is then followed by an identifier and \verb+{+. A staff consist of
musical notes and musical rests which is declared by using \verb+n+, or \verb+r+, inside the \textit{staff block}.
The staff, is terminated by \verb+}+. The, \verb+n+, or, \verb+r+, which is declared inside the \textit{staff block} both takes an argument.

\subsubsection{\texttt{n}}

\np The \verb+n+ keyword signifies the beginning of a musical note. It must be declared
inside the staff block.
It takes 2 parameters; the \textgray{<length>} and the \textgray{<note>} of the
musical note, each separated by a comma. It must end with a semicolon: 

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      n <length>, <note>;
\end{Verbatim}

\paragraph{\texttt{<note>}} The parameter \textgray{<note>} consist of a \verb+key+ and an \verb+octave+. It shall be in the form of \verb+[a-g](#|b)?[0-9]+:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
  c4 // [abcdefg](b|#)?[0-9]
  ||
  |`--->octave 4
  v
 key 'c'
\end{Verbatim}
The above has a key 'c' at octave 4.

\np To play a whole note ringing at c4:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      staff foo {
        n 1, c4;
      }
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{notes/1c}
\end{center}

a half of a note ringing at d4:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      staff foo {
        n 2, d4;
      }
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{notes/2d}
\end{center}

and a quarter of a note ringing at e4:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      staff foo {
        n 4, e4;
      }
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{notes/4e}
\end{center}

\np One can derive the length of the note from the denominator of these notes:
\verb+1/1 1/2 1/4+

\subparagraph{dyad}
The parameter \textgray{<note>} may be entered for a number of times:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      staff foo {
        n 4, c4 e4 g4;
      }
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{notes/dyad_ceg}
\end{center}

\np The example above plays the C major chord at root position as whole note. (Integer overflow is not
protected; you might hear undesirable sounds.)

\np Dotted notes are implemented which reduces the duration of the playing of
that note. To use dots, you must to use a period. An example below is a 1/4 dotted note:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      staff foo {
        n 4., c4;
        n 4..,d4;
      }
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{notes/cpdpp}
\end{center}

\np There is no limit on how many dots you can enter; what's stopping you
is the limit to what the human ears can recognized.

\np The key from A-G is supported, and the octave it takes must be an integer
from 0 to 9.

\np To use accidentals, append \verb+#+ to the first letter of the note to raise the note a semitone and to lower the
note a semitone, append \verb+b+ to the first letter of the note:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      staff foo {
        n 1, c#4;
        n 2, db4;
      }
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{notes/csdf}
\end{center}

\np Unlike the parameter \textgray{length>}, arithmetic operation is illegal
to perform on a \textgray{<note>}. so \textgray{<note>+<note>} is prohibited.

\np To play a chord or a dyad, like \textgray{c4 e4 g4}, one just needs to write as it is:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      n 4, c4 e4 g4;
\end{Verbatim}

\textbf{NOTE} If all these notes is played as staccato, append,
\textgray{.}, to them, so, it becomes, \textgray{c4. e4. g4.}

\paragraph{\texttt{<length>}} For argument, \textgray{<length>}, it may be in the form of integer or floating point number:
\label{nlength}

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      n 4.0, <note>;
      n 4, <note>;
\end{Verbatim}

\np To simulate a tie, use \verb-+-

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      n 4+4, 440; /* is equivalent to: */
      n 2, 440; 
\end{Verbatim}

\np How the former is equivalent to \textgray{n 2, 440;} might
not make sense as, $4+4$ is mathematically equal to 8. Instead
of treating this as an addition operation which sums up two
operands (which is confusing), consider to pronouce it as
\textit{four-tie-four} instead of \textit{four-plus-four}.
 
\textbf{NOTE} Other arithmetic operations are prohibited.

\np The paramater, \textgray{<length>}, will take any real positive integer (as long as it's in the range of int),
so a length of \verb+3+ will work (equivalent to 1/3 of a note), \verb+5+ will work (equivalent to 1/5
of a note) and others.

\np To play a 1/8 note triplet, one may need to do some math:

\begin{align}
	\shortintertext{Multiply 1/8 with 2:}
	\frac{1}{8}2 = \frac{2}{8} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{4} \\
	\shortintertext{divide the answer with 3 (3 for triplet):}
	\frac{1}{4(3)} = \frac{1}{12}
\end{align}

and use the denominator, \verb+12+, as the value of the length:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      staff foo {
        n 12, c4;
        n 12, d4;
        n 12, e4;
      }
\end{Verbatim}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{notes/4triplet_cde}
\end{center}

This process can be repeates for 1/8 note quadruplet, but instead of dividing
with 3 in step (2), it's divided with 4 (4 for quadruplet) and so on.


\subsubsection{\texttt{r}}

\np The \verb+r+ keyword signifies the beginning of a musical rest. It must be
declared inside the \textit{staff block}. It takes one parameter; the
length of the rest:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      r <length>;
\end{Verbatim}

\np The syntax of \textgray{<length>} is similar to the definition in 
\autoref{nlength}.

\subsubsection{Extensions}

\subsection{\texttt{track}}
\np A declaration of variable of type,
\verb+track+, must be immdediately followed by its identifier, followed by
an assignment to one of synthesizers taking a type, \verb+staff+. 
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
       track foo = synth.psg(pol);
\end{Verbatim}

or other variable of type ,\verb+track+.
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      track foo = synth.psg(pol);
      track bar = foo;
\end{Verbatim}

\np To append these supported types, a comma must be added, followed by an rvalue:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      track foo = synth.psg(bar), synth.psg(bar);
\end{Verbatim}


\subsubsection{Extensions}

\np The length of the rest is semantically similar to one of that length
of the note. Refer to the \verb+n+ keyword.

\subsection{Formatting}
\label{formatting}
\np To preserve the readability of the text, it is a recommended practice to add a comment for every
beginning measure, regardless of the time signature. Below is a 4/4 time signature:
\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      staff foo {
        // Measure 1
        n 1, c4;
  
        // Measure 2
        n 4, d4;
        n 4, e4;
        n 4, f4;
        n 4, g4;
  
        // Measure 3
        n 2, a4;
        n 2, b4;
      }
\end{Verbatim}
