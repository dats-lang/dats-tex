(A complete list of synths supported by dats can be listed by running \texttt{dats -{}-list-synths})

\np In this document, a synth takes a staff, (optionally, with arguments), and returns a track.

\np Usually, a composer would like to spice things up, add some punch or tweak some
parameters of the synth, in this case, values or strings, may be passed to the options provided
by the synth. These are always enclosed in a bracket:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      synth.synth_name(staff)[synth_option1=123];
\end{Verbatim}

Sucession of options can be done by appending a comma followed by an another option:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
      synth.synth_name(staff)[
          synth_option1=123,
          synth_option2=123,
          synth_option3="test"];
\end{Verbatim}

\np A list of options provided by a synth can be found by running,
\texttt{dats -{}-list-options synth\char`_name}. (not yet implemented)
